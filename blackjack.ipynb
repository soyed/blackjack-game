    "# Milestone Project 2 - Blackjack Game\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Complete BlackJack Card Game in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need to create a simple text-based [BlackJack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) game\n",
    "* The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.\n",
    "* The player can stand or hit.\n",
    "* The player must be able to pick their betting amount.\n",
    "* You need to keep track of the player's total money.\n",
    "* You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Style\n",
    "\n",
    "* OOP and classes in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Card\n",
    "* A game card is printed with a box dash. The card rank is printed as well\n",
    "* All dealer's cards are hidden except the first card\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes, Methods, global Variables\n",
    "* Create global variables to track:\n",
    "  * current player\n",
    "  * card suit, rank and Value\n",
    "* Create a Card, Deck, and Bet classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Card Values\n",
    "* All face cards (**Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K)**) count as 10.\n",
    "* Ace counts as 1 or 11 according to player choice\n",
    "  * An ace can turn to 1 when\n",
    "    * the game winner needs to be determined and a player sum exceeds 21 but has an ace among their cards\n",
    "      * In this case, if the sum will be less than 21 with ace  becomes 1. \n",
    "      * This is a valid operation and they player has therefore not **BUST**\n",
    "* All other cards count for their number 2 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determine number of decks to play with\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Player Options\n",
    "* A player has the following options:\n",
    "  * Split\n",
    "    * A split occurs if the first two cards have the same value.\n",
    "    * The player has the option to split or perform other actions\n",
    "    * If a player decides to split\n",
    "      * The two cards are split into separate bets\n",
    "      * Each split has its own bet and the player can perform independent actions on each split\n",
    "    * Note:\n",
    "      * Multiple split can occur within a split \n",
    "  * Stand\n",
    "    * A player **Stand** means the player has decided to take no more cards.\n",
    "      * Note:\n",
    "        * When a player stands, the dealer must reveal their cards.\n",
    "          * If the dealer cannot take a stand yet, the dealer must continue to hit until the dealer hits a stand\n",
    "            * This means the sum of dealers can must be at least 17.\n",
    "  * Hit\n",
    "    * If a player decides to **HIT**, the player must add an extra card to their cards\n",
    "      * Note:\n",
    "        * If a player card sum exceeds 21 after a **HIT**, that player has BUST. \n",
    "          * This means the dealer automatically wins the round!\n",
    "  * Double\n",
    "    * If a player decides to Double, this means the player doubles their wager\n",
    "    * Next, the player must **HIT**. \n",
    "    * Finally, the game condition will be checked and a winner will be determined.\n",
    "      * Note:\n",
    "        * **Dealer Stand** must take effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Game States\n",
    "* BlackJack\n",
    "  * If a player has a total of 21 from the first two cards, that is a **BlackJack**.\n",
    "    * This means this player has automatically won the round\n",
    "* Push\n",
    "  * A push occurs when the dealer and player have the total card sum\n",
    "  * The player and dealer gets to keep their wager\n",
    "* Bust\n",
    "  * A bust occurs when one of the players exceed 21\n",
    "  * A bust occurs for a player has a higher score than the dealer \n",
    "  * Loser loses their bet.\n",
    "* Win\n",
    "  * A win occurs when a player has a lower card sum than the dealer\n",
    "  * A win can also occur if a dealer or player **BUST**\n",
    "  * The winners get to keep the total wager\n",
    "  * Note:\n",
    "    * If both players exceed a total of 21, the player with the lower score gets \n",
    "* Dealer Stand\n",
    "  * A dealer must relieve their hidden cards when a player decided to **STAND**.\n",
    "  * Note:\n",
    "    * After the dealer relieves their hidden cards,\n",
    "    * If the dealer's sum is less than 17\n",
    "      * the dealer must hit until a sum of at least 17 has been reached \n",
    "    * Once this condition is satisfied:\n",
    "      * Check game condition and determine the winner\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continue Games\n",
    "* If a game status has been determined, Ask player if they would like to continue the game?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reset game\n",
    "- Reset deck"
